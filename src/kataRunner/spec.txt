It differs from a deck in that the stream continues, and adapts as the user 'powers up'.

- It should have a power bar.

- It should have a current level indicator.

- It should have nav/action buttons.

- It should have milestone indicators.

- It should a stream of kata challenges until the user maxes out the power bar.

- When the user maxes out the power bar, it should update the milestone tokens.

- When the milestone tokens are maxed out, the level should update.

- There should be intermediate status views that show up at the transitions between states.

- kata
